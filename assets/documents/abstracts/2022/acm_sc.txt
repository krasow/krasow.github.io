In the fields of science and engineering, lossy compression plays a growing 
role in running scientific simulations, as output data is on the scale of
terabytes. Using error bounded lossy compression reduces the amount of 
storage for each simulation; however, there is no known bound for the upper
limit of lossy compressibility. Data correlation structures, compressors and
error bounds are factors allowing larger compression ratios and improved 
quality metrics. This provides one direction towards quantifying lossy 
compressibility. Our previous work explored 2D statistical methods to 
characterize the data correlation structures and their relationships, through 
functional models, to compression ratios and quality metrics for 2D scientific
data. In this poster, we explore the expansion of our statistical methods to 
3D scientific data. The method was comparable to 2D. Our work is the next step
towards evaluating the theoretical limits of lossy compressibility used to 
predict compression performance and optimally adapt compressors.
