The Von-Neumann architecture has been in common-place for the last few decades. 
Much of the execution time on these systems is spent on memory transactions. This
bottleneck can be lessened by utilizing processors in memory (PIM). Utilizing a data-centric
computing model, we are expected to have speedups and reduction in energy consumption 
for workloads that can utilize fine grain threading. This work explores decision-support
query (e.g., TPC-H) implementation on UPMEM. Future work explores targeting UPMEM 
using the Village toolchain.
