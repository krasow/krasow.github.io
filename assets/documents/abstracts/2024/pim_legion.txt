Processing in Memory (PIM) is an accelerator emerging in many fields, offering significant potential 
for enhancing high-performance computing (HPC) applications. Effectively mapping an HPC application 
onto this architecture is challenging due to its unique instruction set, network topology, memory/cache
layout, clock frequency, and programming model. In this presentation, we focus on the UPMEM PIM solution,
the first general-purpose open-source PIM solution. Our primary objective is to integrate UPMEM PIM with
HPC clusters by leveraging a well-vetted HPC runtime. Legion, a runtime system developed by collaborators
at LANL, SLAC, NVIDIA, and Stanford University, uses data layout to schedule kernels onto a heterogeneous
distributed HPC system. This presentation showcases the ongoing attempt of integrating UPMEM PIM to the
backend of the Legion runtime system.
