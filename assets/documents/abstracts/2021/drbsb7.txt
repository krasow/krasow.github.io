Lossy compression plays a growing role in scientific simulations where the cost
of storing their output data can span terabytes. Using error bounded lossy
compression reduces the amount of storage for each simulation; however, there is
no known bound for the upper limit on lossy compressibility. Correlation structures
in the data, choice of compressor and error bound are factors allowing larger compression
ratios and improved quality metrics. Analyzing these three factors provides one direction 
towards quantifying lossy compressibility. As a first step, we explore statistical methods
to characterize the correlation structures present in the data and their relationships, 
through functional regression models, to compression ratios. We observed a relationship 
between compression ratios and several statistics summarizing the correlation structure of 
the data, which is a first step towards evaluating the theoretical limits of lossy 
compressibility used to eventually predict compression performance and adapt compressors
to correlation structures present in the data.
